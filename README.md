- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thiagotico, an experienced coder who was working with education for the past 2 years but is now getting back to this wonderful world of coding (and also trying to find old codes written by me to use as portfolio as well as studying and solving lots of coding exercises everyday).

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Java, Math, OOP, MySQL and I also love to solve coding and Math challenges. Whenever I face some challenge I don't know how to do, I try to approach it without looking for theory and stuff like formulas or known algorithms.

(SPOILER ALERT): 
IF YOU HAVE INTENTIONS OS SOLVING PROJECT EULER, DON'T OPEN MY SOLUTIONS!
